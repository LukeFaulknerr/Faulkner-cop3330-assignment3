extractData
    Create tools to parse through the input file
    Create a String to hold the current string
    Create a boolean to hold whether the string is already in the ArrayList
    While there are still lines to parse
        Split the line into an array of Strings
        For each String in this array
            Add the first name with a frequency of one to the ArrayList
            In each iteration after,
                If the name is already in the ArrayList, increase its freq by 1
                If not, add the name with a frequency of one
    return the ArrayList
